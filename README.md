# Composer Links VS Code Extension

> **Deprecated** - Suggest using [Composer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.composer-php-vscode) instead. It contains the same features, and more.

This extension shows information about installed packages when you hover over them in your `composer.json` file.

You can see the description, exact installed version, and links to Packagist and GitHub.
